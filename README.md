# cherryot.com-portfolio
For my portfolio!
I am creating this repository to connect it to github pages or netlify (may change) and host it!
This is my first time having to do this (getting my website out there.)

# UPDATE
I changed my site and connected it with my Adobe Portfolio since I have a subscription (It'd be a waste if I don't use it).
