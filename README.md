For my portfolio!
I am creating this repository to connect it to github pages or netlify (may change) and host it!
This is my first time having to do this (getting my website out there.)


UPDATE:
i integrated my domain to my adobe portfolio since I have a subscription, I thought, might as well use it since I am paying for it, so I had to stop using this repository in hosting my site.
